# FarCryCoding
I wish to keep only algorithm implementations / tutorials here so that I can find them easily. 
[coding-creed-origins](https://github.com/fahimfarhan/coding-creed-origins) is bloated, and I can't find things in there.

To my future self: Let's make some rules:
1. For sample problems, file names should be `<platformName>-<problemNumber>-<problemTitle>.<extension>`
  For example, `leetCode-127-word-ladder.cpp`, `codeForces-1639A-treasure-hunt.cpp`, etc.
2. Since file name is self explainatory, let's create commit messages based on problem categories / tags.
  For example, a sample commit message 
```bash
:rocket: `hard(Lt-007):`  #tags graph bfs string hash_set microsoft(4) google(3)
```
  I mean, I'm not working on a project, so I don't need a title, followed by bullet points explaining what was the 
  problem, what the feature should be, what I did to implement it, etc in a commit message.
3. Keep it simple stupid! (KISS)

(Yeah, I watch others' solutions a lot because if it takes more than 20 minutes, you probably can't figure it out. So one should 
study related topics, see some example solutions etc. )
