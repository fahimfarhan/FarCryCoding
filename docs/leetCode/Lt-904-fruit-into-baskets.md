# Lt 904 Fruit into Basket

## Solution

## Overview
In this problem, we are given an input array representing different types of fruits and two baskets.


![904-example_2.png](./img/904-example_1.png)

We want to collect some fruits from a subarray. However, each basket can only hold one type of fruit. In other words, we can collect at most 2 types of fruits.

Take the picture below as an example:

![904-example_2.png](./img/904-example_2.png)

The task is to find out the maximum number of fruits we can collect under this premise.

To start with, we focus on the mathematical part of the problem, this question equals: Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray that contains at most 2 unique integers. 
(We will call such subarray a valid subarray for convenience).

## Approach 1: Brute Force
### Intuition
Let's start with the most straightforward method, brute force! That is, to check every subarray and find out the longest valid one.

The steps are simple:

Iterate over all subarrays.
For each subarray, we count the types of fruits it contains. If the subarray has no more than 2 types of fruits, meaning it is valid, we take its length to update the maximum length.
<!--Take the following slides as an example:-->

## Algorithm

1. Initialize max_picked = 0 to track the maximum number of fruits we can collect.

2. Iterate over the left index left of subarrays.
3. For every subarray start at index left, iterate over every index right to fix the end of subarray.
4. For each subarray (left, right), count the types of fruits it contains.
5. If there are no more than 2 types, this subarray is valid, we take its length to update max_picked.
6. Otherwise, if the current subarray is invalid, we move on to the next subarray.
7. Once we finish the iteration, return max_picked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        // Maximum number of fruits we can pick
        int maxPicked = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all subarrays (left, right)
        for (int left = 0; left < fruits.size(); ++left) {
            for (int right = 0; right < fruits.size(); ++right) {
                // Use a set to count the type of fruits.
                set<int> basket;
                
                // Iterate over the current subarray.
                for (int currentIndex = left; currentIndex <= right; ++currentIndex) {
                    basket.insert(fruits[currentIndex]);
                }
                
                // If the number of types of fruits in this subarray (types of fruits) 
                // is no larger than 2, this is a valid subarray, update 'maxPicked'.
                if (basket.size() <= 2) {
                    maxPicked = max(maxPicked, right - left + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return 'maxPicked' as the maximum length (maximum number of fruits we can pick).
        return maxPicked;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
Let $n$ be the length of the input array fruits.

### Time complexity: $O(n^3)$

* We have three nested loops, the first loop for the left index left, the second loop for the right index right, and the third loop for the index currentIndex between left and right.
* In each step, we need to add the current fruit to the set basket, which takes constant time.
* For each subarray, we need to calculate the size of the basket after the iteration, which also takes constant time.
* Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(n^3)$.
### Space complexity: $O(n)$

* During the iteration, we need to count the types of fruits in every subarray and store them in a hash set. In the worst-case scenario, there could be O(n)O(n) different types in some subarrays, thus it requires O(n)O(n) space complexity.
* Therefore, the overall space complexity is $O(n)$.

## Approach 2: Optimized Brute Force
I'm gonna skip this one.

## Approach 3: Sliding Window
### Intuition
Can we further reduce the time complexity? The answer is Yes!

Recall how we restart the iteration in approach 2:
```
If the current fruit at index right makes our window (left, right) have 3 types of fruit, we need to break the iteration over 
right and start over from index left + 1.
```

The question is, is this step necessary? Do we need to recalculate the types of fruits from left + 1 again?

If we have found a valid window of size k starting at index left, even though we want to restart at left + 1, there is
no need to recalculate the fruit type from left + 1 all to way to right, which represent windows of size no larger than k.
We only need to look for windows larger than k!

![904_sw_3.png](./img/904_sw_exp.png)
Thus the logic becomes very clear: we let indexes left and right represent the size of the longest valid window we have encountered so far. In further iterations, instead of looking for smaller windows, we just check if the newly added fruit expands the window.

More specifically: we always add fruits from the right side to temporarily increase the window size by 1 (Let's say from k to k + 1), and if the new window is valid, it means that we have managed to find a larger window of size k + 1, great! Otherwise, this means that we haven't encountered a valid window of size k + 1 yet, so we should go back to the previous window size, by removing one fruit from the left side of the window.

Take the following slides as an example:

## Algorithm
1. Start with an empty window with left and right as its left and right index.
2. We iterate over right and add fruits[right] to this window.
3. If the number is no larger than 2, meaning that we collect no more than 2 types of fruits, this subarray is valid.
4. Otherwise, it is not the right time to expand the window and we must keep its size. Since we have added one fruit from the right side, we should remove one fruit from the left side of the window, and increment left by 1.
5. Once we are done iterating, the difference between left and right stands for the longest valid subarray we encountered, i.e. the maximum number of fruits we can collect.

## Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        // Hash map 'basket' to store the types of fruits.
        unordered_map<int, int> basket;
        int left, right;
        
        // Add fruit from the right index (right) of the window.
        for (left = 0, right = 0; right < fruits.size(); ++right) {
            basket[fruits[right]]++;
            
            // If the current window has more than 2 types of fruit,
            // we remove one fruit from the left index (left) of the window.
            if (basket.size() > 2) {
                basket[fruits[left]]--;
                if (basket[fruits[left]] == 0)
                    basket.erase(fruits[left]);
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        // Once we finish the iteration, the indexes left and right 
        // stands for the longest valid subarray we encountered.
        return right - left;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
Let $n$ be the length of the input array fruits.

### Time complexity: $O(n)$

* Both indexes left and right only monotonically increased during the iteration, thus we have at most 2 \cdot n2â‹…n steps,
* At each step, we update the hash set by addition or deletion of one fruit, which takes constant time.
* In summary, the overall time complexity is O(n) 
### Space complexity: O(n)O(n)

* In the worst-case scenario, there might be at most O(n) types of fruits inside the window. 
Take the picture below as an example. Imagine that we have an array of fruits like the following. 
(The first half is all one kind of fruit, while the second half is n/2 types of fruits)


![904_sc_1.png](./img/904_sc_1.png)
In the first half of the iteration, the window size is expanded to n/2, i.e. O(n)O(n). In the second half of the iteration, 
since we have to keep the window size, so it will contain all the n/2 types of fruits and end up with O(n)O(n) space.

![904_sc_2.png](./img/904_sc_2.png)
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n)

## Approach 4: Sliding Window II

## Intuition

In the previous approach, we keep the window size non-decreasing. However, we might run into cases where the window contains O(n)O(n) types of fruits and takes O(n)O(n) space.

This can be optimized by making sure that there are always at most 2 types of fruits in the window. After adding a new fruit from the right side right, 
if the current window has more than 2 types of fruit, we keep removing fruits from the left side left until the current window has only 2 types of fruit. 
Note that the window size may become smaller than before, thus we cannot rely on left and right to keep track of the maximum number of fruits we can collect. 
Instead, we can just use a variable max_picked to keep track of the maximum window size we encountered.

![904_sc_2.png](./img/904_sc_3.png)
For the details on the implementation, let's take a look at the following slides.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize max_picked = 0 as the maximum fruits we can collect, and use hash map basket to record the types of fruits in the current window.

2. Start with an empty window having left = 0 and right = 0 as its left and right index.

3. We iterate over right and add fruits[right] to this window.
  * If there are no more than 2 types of fruits, this subarray is valid.
  * Otherwise, we need to keep removing fruits from the left side until there are only 2 types of fruits in the window.
  Then we update max_picked as max(max_picked, right - left + 1).

4. Once we finish iterating, return max_picked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.

## Implementation
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        // We use a hash map 'basket' to store the number of each type of fruit.
        unordered_map<int, int> basket;
        int left = 0, maxPicked = 0;
        
        // Add fruit from the right index (right) of the window.
        for (int right = 0; right < fruits.size(); ++right) {
            basket[fruits[right]]++;
            
            // If the current window has more than 2 types of fruit,
            // we remove fruit from the left index (left) of the window,
            // until the window has only 2 types of fruit.
            while (basket.size() > 2) {
                basket[fruits[left]]--;
                if (basket[fruits[left]] == 0)
                    basket.erase(fruits[left]);
                left++;
            }
            
            // Update maxPicked.
            maxPicked = max(maxPicked, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        // Return maxPicked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
        return maxPicked;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
Let nn be the length of the input array fruits.

### Time complexity: O(n) 

Similarly, both indexes left and right are only monotonically increasing during the iteration, thus we have at most 2 \cdot n2â‹…n steps,
At each step, we update the hash set by addition or deletion of one fruit, which takes constant time. Note that the number of additions or deletions does not exceed nn.
To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(n) 
### Space complexity: O(1)

We maintain the number of fruit types contained in the window in time. Therefore, at any given time, there are at most 3 types of fruits in the window or the hash map basket.
In summary, the space complexity is O(1).
