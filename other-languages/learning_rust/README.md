# Rust basics

## Get started


```bash
# $ cargo build # you don't need this, cz cargo run does both compile, and run
$ cargo run
```

Alternatively,
```bash 
$ rustc main.rs # this generates main (executable)
$ ./main

```

But rust plugins for nvim (AstroNvim), and vscode prefer a cargo project, and you get all sorts of stupid errors 
for a single rust file. Hence use the cargo version, and be happy.
